DjangoSeattle.org Website
=========================

This is the code for (http://www.djangoseattle.org)[http://www.djangoseattle.org]

History
-------
The Django Seatte site was created on July 25th, 2009. It was developed by 14 people who were building the site and experimenting at the same time, so it's a bit of a hodgepodge of developer programming styles and modules.

Now on February 1, 2011 that code has been moved to GitHub so community members can update and make improvements.

Ideas for Site Next Steps
-------------------------
Here are some random thoughts on what would make the website better.

* We're mainly using blog and flatpages, though there are a zillion other projects installed. Would be cool to simplify the code-base, which is really just ripping things out we never used.

* It would be useful to apply the latest pip and virtualenv goodness so that the site is easy to setup for new developers wanted to hack on it.

* It also might be nice to host the site in a more publicly accessible place (so many developers can work on).  It's currently hosted on Brian Gershon's personal webfaction account.  pip and virtualenv will help with that too.

* The server-side twitter stuff stopped working awhile back, so Brian Gershon replaced with a JavaScript portlet instead.  Maybe there's some other new social networking goodness that can be applied?

* A fresh coat of paint

* Anything else members of the community want to add
